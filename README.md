## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a **personal knowledge archive**.

It captures:

- Real-world lessons  
- Evolving opinions  
- Practical interpretations of frameworks  
- Operational security challenges  

Everything here is written deliberately and revised as understanding evolves.

This is **not**:

- ❌ A product  
- ❌ A tutorial series  
- ❌ Marketing content  

It is a long-term record of how I think about security.
