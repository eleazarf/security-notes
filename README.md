# security-notes

This repository serves as a personal knowledge archive, focusing on cybersecurity, risk management, and security architecture.

The content here reflects real-world experience: lessons learned, opinions formed over time, and practical interpretations of security frameworks and operational challenges. It is written deliberately and revised as understanding evolves.

This is not a product, a tutorial series, or marketing content. It is a long-term record of how I think about security.
