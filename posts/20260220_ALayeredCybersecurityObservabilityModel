# 📊 Dashboard Design — A Layered Cybersecurity Observability Model

Designing dashboards is not about adding more charts.

It’s about telling a story.

In cybersecurity, that story connects:

Infrastructure → Applications → Users → Business Risk

If your dashboards don’t connect those layers, you’re just collecting metrics.

This document explains how to design dashboards as a **layered, security-aware observability model**.

# 🧠 The Big Idea

A good cybersecurity dashboard answers three questions:

1. Are we under attack?
2. Is something broken?
3. Is the business being impacted?

To answer those properly, your dashboards must be layered.

Infrastructure issues affect applications.  
Application issues affect user experience.  
User experience issues affect revenue and trust.  

And synthetic monitoring validates everything from the outside.

# 🏢 1️⃣ Business Security Dashboard (Executive View)

This is where technical problems become business risk.

Executives don’t care about CPU spikes.  
They care about:

- Revenue loss  
- Fraud increase  
- Customer churn  
- Reputation damage  

## 🎯 What this dashboard should show

- Sales Value
- Refund Value
- Refund Rate (fraud signal)
- Conversion Rate
- Abandoned Checkout
- Sales by Region (geo risk visibility)
- Payment Method distribution
- Payments vs Refund ratio

## 🔐 Add Security Context

Now layer in risk signals:

- Chargeback trend
- Fraud percentage
- Suspicious transaction rate
- Bot traffic impact on checkout
- Security incidents affecting payments

This is where cybersecurity becomes visible as business impact.

## 🔗 How Risk Impacts Revenue

# 🌐 2️⃣ Browser & Client Security Dashboard (User Experience Layer)

This layer focuses on what users actually experience.

But in cybersecurity, we also care about:

- Script tampering
- Injection attempts
- Bot traffic
- Client-side errors

## 🎯 What to monitor

Performance:

- HTTP Error Rate
- Page Load Time
- Page Views Per Minute
- LCP
- FID
- CLS

Security:

- CSP violations
- Payment page script integrity
- Suspicious JS injection attempts
- Bot percentage
- Anomalous client errors

If this layer is compromised, trust erodes fast.

# ⚙️ 3️⃣ APM / Backend Security Dashboard

This is the bridge between infrastructure and user experience.

Here you detect:

- Service instability
- API abuse
- Authentication attacks
- Backend failures

## 🎯 Monitor

Operational:

- API Calls per Minute
- Error Rate per Minute
- CPU / Memory usage
- Logs

Security:

- Authentication failure spikes
- Suspicious IP rate
- WAF blocks
- Rate-limit triggers
- Privilege escalation attempts
- 4xx / 5xx anomaly spikes

Backend anomalies are often early signs of:

- Brute force attacks
- API abuse
- Credential stuffing
- Data exfiltration attempts

---

## 🔗 Backend Risk Flow

```

# 🏗 4️⃣ Infrastructure Security Dashboard

This is the foundation.

If this layer is compromised, everything above it becomes unreliable.

## 🎯 Monitor

Operational:

- CPU
- Memory
- Disk Usage
- Network Throughput

Security:

- Firewall deny rate
- IDS/IPS alerts
- Failed SSH attempts
- Unexpected outbound traffic
- File integrity monitoring
- Privileged container detection
- Lateral movement indicators

Infrastructure compromise doesn’t stay quiet.
It always moves upward.

---

## 🔗 Infrastructure Risk Propagation

```mermaid

    FirewallAlerts --> ThreatDetection
    SSHFailures --> BruteForce
    UnusualOutbound --> DataExfiltration
    DataExfiltration --> Breach
    Breach --> BusinessImpact
```

# 🛰 5️⃣ Synthetic Monitoring (Outside-In Security)

Synthetic monitoring answers the simplest question:

> From the outside… does everything look secure and available?

It validates:

- Website availability
- API health
- TLS certificate validity
- Payment gateway uptime
- DNS integrity
- Secure header configuration

It’s your early warning system.

---

## 🔗 Synthetic Validation Model

```mermaid

    Website --> IntegrityCheck
    API --> AvailabilityCheck
    PaymentGateway --> SLAValidation
```

# 🧩 The Full Security Observability Stack

Everything connects.

Nothing should exist in isolation.

# 🎯 What Makes a Security Dashboard “Good”?

A mature cybersecurity dashboard:

- Connects technical alerts to business risk
- Shows cause and effect
- Allows drill-down from executive → forensic detail
- Separates noise from meaningful signals
- Helps teams decide what to do next

---

# 🚫 Common Security Dashboard Mistakes

- Too many raw logs, no context  
- Alerts without business translation  
- Isolated WAF dashboard not connected to revenue impact  
- Infrastructure monitoring disconnected from fraud monitoring  
- No outside-in validation  

---

# ✅ Final Thought

Cybersecurity dashboards are not about visibility.

They are about understanding impact.

Infrastructure incidents move upward.  
Business anomalies trigger investigation downward.

When your dashboards are layered and connected, monitoring becomes resilience.

That’s when observability becomes cybersecurity intelligence.
